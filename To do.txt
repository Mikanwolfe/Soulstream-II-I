
Potions and the Quick-Use slots.

Inventory:
ability to buy items, random items as well.
applying itemstats to the character.


There are currently 8 keys, asdfzxcv, soinstead of allowing all of them to go to skills, they can be assigned to potions as well.
This will probably be a bit harder to do - instead of leading to the potion itself, it can use the quickslot to reroute to the appropriate buff.

Itemstring:

[TYPE] [ID] [OTHER INFO]

TYPE:

0 = Empty slot
1 = Equipment/Misc.
2 = Potion

ID:
IDs effect how the system processes the info.
FOR EXAMPLE:

Potion, basic hp/mp potion is ID 1

so: 

2 1 50 0
Item, HP Potion, Heal is 50HP and 0MP

This will tell the system that it should process the next two numbers as HP and MP modifiers respectively.
