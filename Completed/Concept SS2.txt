Luminous Future Studios

::=======================================================================================================::
Concept:

Soulstream 2 (SS2) will be an improved version of the original soulstream (SS). the reason for this is because the
original soulstream's systems are quite old and are inefficient. SS2 will retain many of the aspects of the
the original SS but will have major improvments. some major improvements include:

Graphics - no longer will the display be limited to a 40x30 space but will be more detailed
System Design - Using newer techniques soulstream can be worked to make it faster and more reliable.
UI - The unser interfaces will be reworked so that the interfaces are not as intimitating and can be used easily
Gameplay - SS2 gameplay will be more dynamic and early-game battles will not be decided by the great random.

some other features that will be included are:

character features/art - Characters will have some sort of design or equipment so that it won't just be a - and a + anymore
Improved and more diverse skills - though a significant proportion of the skills will remain, some will not and will be replaced by better ones
Dynamic skill leveling - skills will have more levels and different unlockables and dynamics to improve gameplay
Improved passive skills - passive stats or skills will be added so that players will have more personalisation.
Improved stats - the stat concept of the original SS will be revised and reworked so that it will by more efficient and work well with SS2

of course there will be other improvements coming along though remaking a game that took 2~3 years again from scratch will take quite some time
though i bring aboard some help this time so things can move along more smoothly.
