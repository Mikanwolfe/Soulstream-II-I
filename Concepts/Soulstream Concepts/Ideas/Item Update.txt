
Ideas for concepts:

Items:

FindMyWeapon Fuction, a single function (decoder function based) to declare single items.
So players get different ItemVariables, eg.

Item Armour Variables as .IAV

Head Variable as p1.iav.%itemID%
Torso Variable as p1.iav.%itemID%
Leggings Variable
Shoes Variable
Gloves Variable
Ring Variable
Misc Variable

Player Item Slots

players can equip armour as well as store a limited amount of items,
might impliment the ability to extend itemstorage space

Player1 ItemSlot 1 as p1.is.1
Player2 ItemSlot 4 as p2.is.4

Enchantments:

Enchantments saved as eIDs as p1.eid.%eid%

eid(s) attached to player slot variables, so a head variable with an eID means that the armour has that eID

eg. Magnanimous Gold Ring - +100% Meso/Exp Gain
